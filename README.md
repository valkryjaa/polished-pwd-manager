# Password Manager for Chrome

## DISCLAIMER:
Disclaimer from Valkryja. Don't take this serious. I'm just messing around with css and html for the fun of it and to test certain code i know on a project that's a good start for that type of code.

### NOTE: 
This project is a **proof of concept** / **sample application** for a chromium based web-browser and originated form the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpuomoEUbgQ

This extension **does not provide a secure password storage** (as of now 18th March 2022) and therefor it is not recomeded to be used for other than educational purposes.
